# Compression Tool

## Coding Challenge #3 - Huffman Encoding/Decoding tool

This repository holds the source code completing the thrid challenge from [CodingChallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-huffman).

This tool can encode a file using the compression technique introduced by David Hoffman, and consequently, decode it as well. See the link above for a short explanation. 

## Usage 

Run the following to make an executable file on MAC/Linux environments: 

`make build-mac`

OR 

Run the following for Windows: 

`make build-windows`

You can run the tool using: 

```bash
TODO
```

OR 

```bash
TODO
```

If you prefer to not create the executable and directly run this, you can use: 

`make run`

## Test

To run the tests, you can use the command: 

`make test`
